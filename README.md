# Advent of Code 2021

This is [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021)

# Project Implementation

This is using [markdown-unlit](https://github.com/sol/markdown-unlit)

Here is a basic example:

```haskell
main :: IO ()
main = putStrLn "That was easy!"
```

To execute the above, ie, to execute this README.md file, run the following:

```
$ ghci README.lhs
```

For the rest of this project, however, it will be in dayX.lhs files, where we just run the whole thing with `cabal run`.
